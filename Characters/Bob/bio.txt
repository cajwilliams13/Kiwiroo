Bob is the first ever subject of Magistrate's Immortal Mutants, a group of experimental men and creatures that can't die at all. Bob is not only the first subject, but a successful one, too successful they messed with his brain and possibly cranked his brain's potential. He escaped the labs and now wonders around Crosswind Hold, finding the reason he breathes in this world.
