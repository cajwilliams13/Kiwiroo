For eons, the moon goddess Io watched over the Realm. But then disaster struck: The Darkness smothered the goddess’s light, and shattered the moon that hangs above our battlefields.

Pieces of the moon fell to the Shattered Desert, where Io’s faithful watched over them. They kept vigil for the shattered goddess, praying that one day she would return.

That day finally came as the Magistrate marched on the moon shards, determined to harness their power in the ongoing war against the Paladins. At the urging of her celestial friend Jenos, Io revealed her true form to fight for her people and stand against the Magistrate.
