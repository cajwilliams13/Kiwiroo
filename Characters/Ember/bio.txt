Born from the couple Krieg Quarta and Scarlet Quarta, Ember Quarta is Quarta family's oldest daughter. She's the most proficient in fights, but her lack of stamina restricts her movements pretty hard.

She and her sisters were thrown into a wormhole that leads to other timelines by Uno, a villain that plans to conquer the world. He made sure to straighten up his path by trying to eliminate the Quarta family.

Now the siblings are trying to find ways to return to their own timeline, while enjoying Crosswind Hold, and observing their parents in this timeline.
